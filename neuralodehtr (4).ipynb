training in order to replace the existing feature extraction layer of resnet model being used in the encodes with a vit(visual transformer ) based model\n#the vit model expects square images which are of size 224*224 or preferabbly dimensions which are divisible by 16 else it wont work properly \n#however the existing code base allows us to modify the imgW (image width) and imgH(image Height) which are training parameters\n#passed using parser and saved into the opt used\n#further vit model doesnt support padding of images but by default train.py adds the padding due to line \n# parser.add_argument('--PAD', action='store_true', help='whether to keep ratio then pad for image resize') so insterad while training\n#we need to pass custom value of -PAD action='store_false'instead during training as a training parameter\n#thankfully no other files need to be modified and image preprocessing of tps which is put in place in the codebase can be followed as it is with these resizing parameters\n#now the major modification is in featureextraction.py where the currently supported models for feature extraction have their codes written \n#the various models supported for feature extraction in the current codebase as of now are \n#VGG,RCNN,ResNet and GRCL \n#now we will add a custom class for vit where we will be training a vit_b_16 model from scratch which is not pretrained with these specification:\n#Input size: 224×224 images\n# Patch size: 16×16\n# Embedding dim: 768\n# Number of heads: 12\n# Transformer depth: 12\n# MLP size: 3072\n# Output: 1000-dim

Large).\n# 16\tPatch size – the image is divided into 16x16 patches before being fed into the transformer.\n#the code added to featureextraction.py is as follows:\n#from torchvision.models.vision_transformer import vit_b_16\n#is added to the top of the featureextraction.py file of the working directory cloned repo file of featureextraction.py\n#further a class of vitfeatureextraction code is also added to allow usage of vit model similar to resnet and other above listed models:\n# class ViT_FeatureExtractor(nn.Module):\n#     \"\"\" Vision Transformer Feature Extractor \"\"\"\n\n#     def __init__(self, input_channel=3, output_channel=512, image_size=224, patch_size=16):\n#         super(ViT_FeatureExtractor, self).__init__()\n\n#         # Initialize a base ViT\n#         self.vit = vit_b_16(pretrained=False)\n        \n#         # Modify input channels if necessary (default ViT uses 3)\n#         if input_channel != 3:\n#             self.vit.conv_proj = nn.Conv2d(input_channel, self.vit.conv_proj.out_channels, kernel_size=patch_size, stride=patch_size)\n\n#         # Optional: reduce to fixed output channels to match rest of

custom paramteres for the default input and output_channel as for rgb images vit needs 3 input channels and 78 output_channels which is contrast to default paramteres\n#default:\n # \n# change to \n# opt.input_channel = 3  # if using RGB images for ViT\n# opt.output_channel = 768 \n#just omit PAD entirely from training parameters to ensure pdding is not done\n#pass --rgb as another training parameter to train on coloured images as well for better accuracy just pass it dont need to give it value as passing it sets it to true as per parser code in train.py \n#one more change \n#change this
